## Auth requirements

- `margin-ratio`, `max-qty`: Public — no login required
- `assets`, `cash-flow`, `portfolio`, `profit-analysis`: 🔐 Requires Quote permission
- `positions`, `fund-positions`, `statement`, `bank-cards`, `withdrawals`, `deposits`: 🔐 Requires Trade permission
- `order`, `dca` (mutating operations): 🔐 Requires Trade permission — **always present a preview before executing, wait for explicit confirmation**

## Frameworks

### Portfolio Diagnosis
Concentration risk, sector distribution, factor exposure, correlation risk. See [references/portfolio-diagnosis.md](references/portfolio-diagnosis.md).

### Portfolio Rebalancing
Weight drift analysis, rebalance trade list, transaction cost and tax impact. See [references/portfolio-rebalance.md](references/portfolio-rebalance.md).

### Asset Allocation
MPT efficient frontier, Black-Litterman, risk parity, all-weather strategy. See [references/asset-allocation.md](references/asset-allocation.md).

### Risk Analysis
VaR (historical/parametric), CVaR, max drawdown, Sharpe/Calmar, historical scenario stress tests. See [references/risk-analysis.md](references/risk-analysis.md).

### Risk-Return Optimization
Risk-adjusted return-optimal portfolios by risk preference and horizon. See [references/risk-return.md](references/risk-return.md).

### Performance Attribution (Brinson)
Allocation/selection/interaction effects, factor alpha/beta, timing ability (T-M model). See [references/performance-attribution.md](references/performance-attribution.md).

### Tax-Loss Harvesting
Identify unrealised losses, suggest substitutes, track 30-day wash-sale window. See [references/tax-harvesting.md](references/tax-harvesting.md).

## Error handling

| Situation | Response |
|---|---|
| `command not found: longbridge` | Install longbridge-terminal |
| `not logged in` / `unauthorized` | Run `longbridge auth login`; tick Trade permission |
| `order` / `dca` mutation | Always preview plan first; wait for user confirmation before executing |
